# SMS Forwarder Android App

A minimal-UI Android app that monitors SMS and notifications in the background, forwarding matching messages to user-defined HTTP APIs based on customizable rules.
forked from huukhanh/SMS-Forwarder

## Features

🔄 **Background SMS & Notification Processing** - Silently captures incoming SMS and app notifications  
📋 **Pattern-Based Rules** - Regex or substring matching against message content  
🌐 **HTTP API Forwarding** - POST/GET/PUT/PATCH to any HTTP endpoint  
📊 **Custom Headers** - Configurable headers for each forwarding rule  
📈 **History Tracking** - Paginated logs with filtering and search capabilities  
🔄 **Auto-Start** - Automatically starts monitoring on device boot  
⚡ **Battery Optimized** - Uses foreground service with minimal notifications  
🎯 **Smart Filtering** - Filter by app, search content, or use pattern matching  
📱 **Modern UI** - Clean Material 3 design with swipe gestures  

## Architecture

- **Clean Architecture** (MVVM + Repository Pattern)
- **Jetpack Compose** for modern UI
- **Room Database** for local persistence with migrations
- **Retrofit + OkHttp** for HTTP networking
- **Hilt** for dependency injection
- **WorkManager** for background tasks
- **Coroutines + Flow** for reactive programming

## Technical Requirements

- **Target SDK**: 34 (Android 14)
- **Minimum SDK**: 29 (Android 10)
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Build System**: Gradle with Kotlin DSL

## Permissions

### Required Permissions
- `RECEIVE_SMS` - Receive incoming SMS messages
- `READ_SMS` - Read SMS content for processing
- `INTERNET` - Send HTTP requests to configured endpoints
- `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` - Auto-start on device boot
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` - Run background service reliably
- `WAKE_LOCK` - Keep device awake during processing

### Protected Permissions

## Key Components

### Message Processing Flow
1. **SmsReceiver** / **NotifRouterService** - Intercept SMS/notifications
2. **SmsForwardingService** - Process messages in foreground service
3. **SmsForwardingUseCase** - Rule matching and HTTP forwarding
4. **HttpClient** - HTTP requests with retry logic
5. **HistoryRepository** - Log all forwarding attempts

### Database Schema
- **Rules**: ID, name, source type, pattern, endpoint, method, headers
- **History**: ID, ruleId, message data, request/response, status, timestamps

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- JDK 17
- Android SDK 34
- Kotlin 1.9+

### Build Instructions
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd SMSForwarder

# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug
